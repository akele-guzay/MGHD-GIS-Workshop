You‚Äôre contacted by the Rwandan Biomedical Center (RBC) Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) Program to assist with some GIS work. The program conducts yearly mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns where they distribute anti soil transmitted helmenthiasis (STH) medicine (albendazole) to pre-school-aged children (Pre-SAC). Once a year, parents bring their children to the closest health center to receive the drugs. The campaigns are preceded by mass mobilization campaigns used to communicate information about the MDA. 

After each MDA, the program reviews it‚Äôs coverage rate by comparing the number of children actually treated vs the projected Pre-SAC count before the launch of the campaign. The unit wants your assistance in visualizing their coverage rate for 2021 at the district level. Furthermore, they would like to compare the coverage rate in relation to the availability and distribution of health centers in the districts. 

They have provided the following two documents

- [2021 STH MDA](https://github.com/akele-guzay/MGHD-GIS-Workshop/blob/main/data/RW_2021_STH.csv)
- [Distribution of health centers]()

## The Task üí™üèΩ

Create two district maps showcasing the following

1. The coverage rate for the 2021 STH MDA in Rwanda
2. The distribution of health centers in relation to the coverage rate

## Steps 
   
- Conceptualize the assignment
	-  What is the required output? 
	- What things do you need?
-  Add a base-map
	-  `A basemap is a layer that provides geographical context to the map and other dataset layers above it.`<sup>(1)</sup>
-  Add Rwanda‚Äôs shapefile
	-  Download the shapefile [here](https://diva-gis.org/gdata)
	- Add it to QGIS
- Add the ‚Äò2021 STH MDA‚Äô file
	- Explore the csv file
- Join the data to the shapefile
- Color the map
	- Include the coverage rates as labels
- Create the coverage rate map
	- Sketch out the structure
- Export the map
	- Pdf 
	- png 
- Add the ‚ÄòDistribution of health centers‚Äô csv file
- Create the health center vs coverage map
- Export the map
